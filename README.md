# Arbin-User-Network

## About
Welcome to the Arbin User Network! This is a community-driven platform where users of Arbin products come together to share their experiences, knowledge, and tools for working with Arbin’s battery testing systems and APIs. 

This repository serves as a collaborative space for scientists, engineers, and researchers to exchange ideas, share best practices, and contribute resources that enhance the use of Arbin equipment for battery research.

Join us to:
* Provide a shared space for users to discuss the **Arbin API** and its implementation.
* Exchange **custom battery testing schedules**.
* Share **tips, tricks, and insights** that improve workflows.
* Offer **support** through collaboration and knowledge-sharing between users.

Whether you're new to Arbin's products or an experienced user, we encourage you to join the conversation, share your experiences, and contribute to the growing knowledge base.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions! If you'd like to share a new testing schedule, improve API usage examples, or offer feedback, please follow the [contribution guide](https://github.com/Arbin-com/Arbin-User-Network/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION.md).

## Folder Structure
This repository is organized into three main sections, each serving a specific purpose. Organizing your contribution into the appropriate folder will help others easily find and benefit from your work.

```
| ARBIN-USER-NETWORK/
| --- API_Implementations/
| --- Testing_Schedules/
| --- Tips_and_Tricks/
```

### 1. API_Implementations
This folder contains code examples and scripts for using the Arbin API. Whether you're automating test setups, collecting data, or building custom integrations, you can find (or contribute) resources here.

### 2. Testing_Schedules
The Testing Schedules folder is where users can share and download unique battery testing protocols used with Arbin cyclers. If you've created a custom test for a specific battery chemistry or experimental condition, please share it!

### 3. Tips_and_Tricks
The Tips and Tricks section is for sharing insights, optimizations, and small improvements that can enhance the use of Arbin products. Whether it’s improving test accuracy, optimizing performance, or finding easier ways to work with the data, feel free to share your expertise.
